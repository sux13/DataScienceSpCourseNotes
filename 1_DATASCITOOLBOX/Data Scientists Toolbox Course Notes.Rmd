## CLI (Command Line Interface)

* `/` = root directory
* `~` = home directory
* `pwd` = print working directory (current directory)
* `clear` = clear screen
* `ls` = list stuff
    *  `-a` = see all (including hidden files)
    *  `-l` = details
* `cd` = change directory
* `mkdir` = make directory
* `touch` = creates an empty file
* `cp` = copy
    * `cp <file> <directory>` = copy a file to a directory
    * `cp <file> <renamed_file>` = rename a file
    * `cp -r <directory> <newDirectory>` = copy all documents from directory to new Directory
            * `-r` = recursive
* `rm` = remove
    * `-r` = remove entire directories (no undo)
* `mv` = move
    * `move <file> <directory>` = move file to directory
    * `move <fileName> <newName>` = rename file
* `echo` = print arguments you give/variables
* `date` = print current date



## GitHub

* **Workflow**
    1. make edits in workspace
    2. update index/add files
    3. commit to local repo
    4. push to remote repository
* `git add .` = add all new files to be tracked
* `git add -u` = updates tracking for files that are renamed or deleted
* `git add -A` = both of the above
    * ***Note**: `add` is performed before committing *
* `git commit -m "message"` = commit the changes you want to be saved to the local copy
* `git checkout -b branchname` = create new branch
* `git branch` = tells you what branch you are on
* `git checkout master` = move back to the master branch
* `git pull` = merge you changes into other branch/repo (pull request, sent to owner of the repo)
* `git push` = commit local changes to remote (GitHub)



## Markdown

* `##` = signifies secondary heading (bold big font)
* `###` = signifies tertiary heading (slightly smaller font than secondary, not bold)
* `*` = bullet list item



## R Packages

* Primary location for R packages $\rightarrow$ CRAN
* `available.packages()` = all packages available
* `head(rownames(a),3)` = returns first three names of a
* `install.packages("nameOfPackage")` = install single package
* `install.packages(c("nameOfPackage", "nameOfPackage", "nameOfPackage")` = install multiple package
* Bioconductor Packages:
    *  `source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")`
    *  `biocLite()` = install bioconductor packages
* `library(packagename)` = load package
* `search()` = see all functions in package after loading



## Types of Data Science Questions

* in order of difficulty: ***Descriptive*** $\rightarrow$ ***Exploratory*** $\rightarrow$ ***Inferential*** $\rightarrow$ ***Predictive*** $\rightarrow$ ***Causal*** $\rightarrow$ ***Mechanistic***
* **Descriptive analysis** = describe set of data, interpret what you see (census, Google Ngram)
* **Exploratory analysis** = discovering connections (correlation does not = causation)
* **Inferential analysis** = use data conclusions from smaller population for the broader group
* **Predictive analysis** = use data on one object to predict values for another (if X predicts Y, does not = X cause Y)
* **Causal analysis** = how does changing one variable affect another, using randomized studies, Strong assumptions, golden standard for statistical analysis
* **Mechanistic analysis** = understand exact changes in variables in other variables, modeled by empirical equations (engineering/physics



## Data
* **Data** = values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items (usually population)
* **Variables** = measurement/characteristic of an item (qualitative vs quantitative)
* **Data** = not always structured, usually raw file, different formats
* Most important thing is question, then it is data
* **Big data** = now possible to collect data cheap, but not necessarily all useful (need the right data)

## Experimental Design
* Formulate your question in advance
* **Statistical inference** = select subset, run experiment, calculate descriptive statistics, use inferential statistics to determine if results can be applied broadly
* ***[Inference]*** **Variability** = lower variability + clearer differences = decision
* ***[Inference]*** **Confounding** = underlying variable might be causing the correlation (sometimes called Spurious correlation)
    * dealing with confounding: fix variables, stratify (all options), randomize
* ***[Prediction]*** collection observations for different variable values, build predictive functions
    *  similar problems of probability/sampling and confounding variables
* ***[Prediction]*** Difficult to understand where observation is from from different distributions. (size of effects important)
* ***[Prediction]*** Positive/negative statuses: True positive, false positive, false negative, true negative
    * **Sensitivity** = Pr(positive test | disease)
    * **Specificity** = Pr(negative test | no disease)
    * **Positive Predictive Value** = Pr(disease | positive test)
    * **Negative Predictive Value** = Pr(no disease | negative test)
    * **Accuracy** = Pr(correct outcome)
* **Data dredging** = use data to fit hypothesis
* **Good experiments** = have replication, measure variability, generalize problem, transparent
* Prediction is not inference, and beware of data dredging
