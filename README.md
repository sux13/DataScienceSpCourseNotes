# Data Science Specialization Course Notes

I have compiled notes for all 9 courses of the Johns Hopkins University/Coursera Data Science Specialization. The notes are all written in **R Markdown** format and cover all concepts convered in class, as well as additional examples I have compiled from lecture, my own exploration, _StackOverflow_, and _Khan Academy_. These documents are intended to be comprehensive sources of reference for future use and they have served me wonderfully in completing the assignments for each course. So I hope you will find them helpful as well. 

They are by no means perfect, so feel free to correct, contribute (send a pull request), or use them in anyway you would like. 

You will find **HTML**, **PDF**, and **R Markdown** files here in this repository in each of the corresponding folders. You can view the HTML versions [here](http://sux13.github.io/DataScienceSpCourseNotes/)
