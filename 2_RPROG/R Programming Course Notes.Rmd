## Overview and History of R
* **R** = dialect of the **S** language
    * S was developed by John Chambers @ Bell Labs
    * initiated in 1976 as internal tool, originally FORTRAN libraries
    * 1988 rewritten in C (version 3 of language)
    * 1998 version 4 (what we use today)
* **History of S**
    * Bell labs $\rightarrow$ insightful $\rightarrow$ Lucent $\rightarrow$ Alcatel-Lucent
    * in 1998, S won the Association for computing machinery’s software system award
* **History of R**
    * 1991     created in New Zealand by Ross Ihaka & RobertGentleman
    * 1993     first announcement of R to public
    * 1995     Martin Machler convinces founders to use GNU General Public license to make R free
    * 1996     public mailing list created R-help and R-devel
    * 1997     R Core Group formed
    * 2000     R v1.0.0 released
* **R Features**
    * Syntax similar to S, semantics similar to S, runs on any platforms, frequent releasees
    * lean software, functionalities in modular packages, sophisticated graphics capabilities
    * useful for interactive work, powerful programming language
    * active user community and ***FREE*** (4 freedoms)
         * freedom to run the program
         * freedom to study how the program works and adapt it
         * freedom to redistribute copies
         * freedom to improve the program
* **R Drawbacks**
    * 40 year-old technology
    * little built-in support for dynamic/3D graphics
    * functionality based on consumer demand
    * objects generally stored in physical memory (limited by hardware)
* **Design of the R system**
    * 2 conceptual parts: base R from CRAN vs. everything else
    * functionality divided into different packages
         * **base R** contains core functionality and fundamental functions
         * other utility packages included in the base install: `util`, `stats`, `datasets`, ...
         * Recommended packages: `bootclass`, `KernSmooth`, etc
    * 5000+ packages available

## Coding Standards
* Always use text files/editor
* Indent code (4 space minimum)
* limit the width of code (80 columns)
* limit the length of individual functions


## Workspace and Files
* `getwd()` = return current working directory
* `setwd()` = set current working directory
* `?function` = brings up help for that function
* `dir.create("path/foldername", recursive = TRUE)` = create directories/subdirectories
* `unlink(directory, recursive = TRUE)` = delete directory and subdirectories
* `ls()` = list all objects in the local workspace
* `list.files(recursive = TRUE)` = list all, including subdirectories
* `args(function)` = returns arguments for the function
* `file.create("name")` = create file
    * `.exists("name")` = return true/false exists in working directory
    * `.info("name")` = return file info
    * `.info("name")$property` = returns value for the specific attribute
    * `.rename("name1", "name2")` = rename file
    * `.copy("name1", "name2")` = copy file
    * `.path("name1")` = return path of file


## R Console and Evaluation
* `<-` = assignment operator
* `#` = comment
* expression is evaluated after hitting `enter` and result is returned
* autoprinting occurs when you call a variable
    * `print(x)` = explicitly printing
* `[1]` at the beginning of the output = which element of the vector is being shown

$\pagebreak$

## R Objects and Data Structures
* 5 basic/**atomic classes** of objects:
    1. character
    2. numeric
    3. integer
    4. complex
    5. logical
* **Numbers**
    * numbers generally treated as `numeric` objects (double precision real numbers - decimals)
    * Integer objects can be created by adding `L` to the end of a number(ex. `1L`)
    * `Inf` = infinity, can be used in calculations
    * `NaN` = not a number/undefined
    * `sqrt(value)` = square root of value
* **Variables**
    * `variable <- value` = assignment of a value to a variable name

### Vectors and Lists
* **atomic vector** = contains one data type, most basic object
    * `vector <- c(value1, value2, ...)` = creates a vector with specified values
    * `vector1*vector2` = element by element multiplication (rather than matrix multiplication)
        * if the vectors are of different lengths, shorter vector will be recycled until the longer runs out
        * computation on vectors/between vectors (`+`, `-`, `==`, `/`, etc.) are done element by element by default
        * `%*%` = force matrix multiplication between vectors/matrices
    * `vector("class", n)` = creates empty vector of length n and specified class
        - `vector("numeric", 3)` = creates 0 0 0
* `c()` = concatenate
    * `T, F` = shorthand for `TRUE` and `FALSE`
    * `1+0i` = complex numbers
* **explicit coercion**
    * `as.numeric(x)`, `as.logical(x)`, `as.character(x)`, `as.complex(x)` = convert object from one class to another
    * nonsensible coercion will result in NA (ex. `as.numeric(c("a", "b")`)
    * `as.list(data.frame)` = converts a `data.frame` object into a `list` object
    * `as.character(list)` = converts list into a character vector
* **implicit coercion**
    * matrix/vector can only contain one data type, so when attempting to create matrix/vector with different classes, forced coercion occurs to make every element to same class
        * *least common denominator* is the approach used (basically everything is converted to a class that all values can take, numbers $\rightarrow$ characters) and *no errors generated*
        * coercion occurs to make every element to same class (implicit)
        - `x <- c(NA, 2, "D")` will create a vector of character class
* `list()` = special vector wit different classes of elements
    - `list` = vector of objects of different classes
    * elements of list use `[[]]`, elements of other vectors use `[]`
* **logical vectors** = contain values `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NA`, values are generated as result of logical conditions comparing two objects/values
* `paste(characterVector, collapse = " ")` = join together elements of the vector and separating with the `collapse` parameter
* `paste(vec1, vec2, sep = " ")` = join together different vectors and separating with the `sep` parameter
    * ***Note**: vector recycling applies here too *
    * `LETTERS`, `letters`= predefined vectors for all 26 upper and lower letters
* `unique(values)` = returns vector with all duplicates removed

### Matrices and Data Frames
* `matrix` can contain **only 1** type of data
* `data.frame` can contain **multiple**
* `matrix(values, nrow = n, ncol = m)` = creates a n by m matrix
    * constructed **COLUMN WISE** $\rightarrow$ the elements are placed into the matrix from top to bottom for each column, and by column from left to right
    * matrices can also be created by adding the dimension attribute to vector
        * `dim(m) <- c(2, 5)`
    * matrices can also be created by binding columns and rows
        * `rbind(x, y)`, `cbind(x, y)`  = combine rows/columns; can be used on vectors or matrices
    * `*` and `/` = element by element computation between two matrices
        * `%*%` = matrix multiplication
* `dim(obj)` = dimensions of an object (returns `NULL` if a vector)
    * `dim(obj) <- c(4, 5)` = assign `dim` attribute to an object
        * if object is a vector, R converts the vector to a n by m matrix (i.e. 4 rows by 5 column from the example command)
            * ***Note**: if n by m is larger than length of vector, then an error is returned*
        * ***example***
```{r}
# initiate a vector
x <-c(NA, 1, "cx", NA, 2, "dsa")
class(x)
x

# convert to matrix
dim(x) <- c(3, 2)
class(x)
x
```
* `data.frame(var = 1:4, var2 = c(….))` = creates a data frame
    * `nrow()`, `ncol()` = returns row and column numbers
    * `data.frame(vector, matrix)` = takes any number of arguments and returns a single object of class "data.frame" composed of original objects
    * `as.data.frame(obj)` = converts object to data frame
    * data frames store tabular data
    * special type of list where every list has the same length (can be of different type)
    * data frames are usually created through `read.table()` and `read.csv()`
    * `data.matrix()` = converts a data frame to matrix.
* `colMeans(matrix)` or `rowMeans(matrix)` = returns means of the columns/rows of a matrix/dataframe in a vector
* `as.numeric(rownames(df))` = returns row indices for rows of a data frame with unnamed rows
* **attributes**
    * objects can have attributes: `names`, `dimnames`, `row.names`, `dim` (matrices, arrays), `class`, `length`, or any user-defined ones
    * `attributes(obj)`, `class(obj)` = return attributes/class for an R object
    * `attr(object, "attribute") <- "value"` = creates/assigns a value to a new/existing attribute for the object
    * `names` attribute
        * all objects can have names
        * `names(x)` = returns names (`NULL` if no name exists)
            * `names(x) <- c("a", …)` = can be used to assign names to vectors
        * `list(a = 1, b = 2, …)` = `a`, `b` are names
        * `dimnames(matrix) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c" , "d"))` = assign names to matrices
            * use list of two vectors: row, column in that order
    * `colnames(data.frame)` = return column names (can be used to set column names as well, similar to `dim()`)
    * `row.names` = names of rows in the data frame (attribute)

### Arrays
* multi-dimensional collection of data with $k$ dimensions
    * matrix = 2 dimensional array
* `array(data, dim, dimnames)`
    - `data` = data to be stored in array
    - `dim` = dimensions of the array
        + `dim = c(2, 2, 5)` = 3 dimensional array $\rightarrow$ creates 5 2x2 array
    - `dimnames` = add names to the dimensions
        + input must be a `list`
        + every element of the `list` must correspond in length to the dimensions of the array
        + `dimnames(x) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"), c("e", "f", "g", "h", "i"))` = set the names for row, column, and third dimension respectively (2 x 2 x 5 in this case)
* `dim()` function can be used to create arrays from vectors or matrices
    - `x <- rnorm(20); dim(x) <- c(2, 2, 5)` = converts a 20 element vector to a 2x2x5 array

### Factors
* factors are used to represent *categorical data* (integer vector where each value has a label)
* 2 types: **unordered** vs **ordered**
* treated specially by `lm()`, `glm()`
* Factors easier to understand because they self describe (vs. 1 and 2)
* `factor(c("a", "b"), levels = c("1", "2"))` = creates factor
    * `levels()` argument can be used to specify baseline levels vs other levels
         * ***Note**:without explicit specification, R uses alphabetical order*
    * `table(factorVar)` = how many of each are in the factor


$\pagebreak$

## Missing Values
* `NaN` or `NA` = missing values
    * `NaN` = undefined mathematical operations
    * `NA` = any value not available or missing in the statistical sense
        -  any operations with `NA` results in `NA`
        -  NA can have different classes potentially (integer, character, etc)
    * ***Note**: NaN is an NA value, but NA is not NaN*
* `is.na()`, `is.nan()` = use to test if each element of the vector is `NA` and `NaN`
    * ***Note**: cannot compare `NA` (with `==`) as it is not a value but a **placeholder** for a quantity that is not available*
* `sum(my_na)` = sum of a logical vector (`TRUE` = 1 and `FALSE` = 0) is effectively the number of `TRUE`s

* **Removing `NA` Values**
    * `is.na()` = creates logical vector where T is where value exists, F is `NA`
        * subsetting with the above result can return only the non NA elements
    * `complete.cases(obj1, obj2)` = creates logical vector where `TRUE` is where both values exist, and `FALSE` is where any is `NA`
        * can be used on data frames as well
        * `complete.cases(data.frame)` = creates logical vectors indicating which observation/row is good
        * `data.frame[logicalVector, ]` = returns all observations with complete data

* **Imputing Missing Values** = replacing missing values with estimates (can be averages from all other data with the similar conditions)


$\pagebreak$

## Sequence of Numbers
* `1:20` = creates a sequence of numbers from first number to second number
    * works in descending order as well
    * increment = 1
* `?':'` = enclose help for operators
* `seq(1, 20, by=0.5)` = sequence 1 to 20 by increment of .5
    * `length=30` argument can be used to specify number of values generated
* `length(variable)` = length of vector/sequence
* `seq_along(vector)` or `seq(along.with = vector)` = create vector that is same length as another vector
* `rep(0, times = 40)` = creates a vector with 40 zeroes
    * `rep(c(1, 2), times = 10)` = repeats combination of numbers 10 times
    * `rep(c(1, 2), each = 10)` = repeats first value 10 times followed by second value 10 times


## Subsetting
* R uses **one based index** $\rightarrow$ starts counting at $1$
    * `x[0]` returns `numeric(0)`, not error
    * `x[3000]` returns `NA` (not out of bounds/error)
* `[]` = always returns object of same class, can select more than one element of an object (ex. `[1:2]`)
* `[[]]` = can extract one element from list or data frame, returned object not necessarily list/dataframe
* `$` = can extract elements from list/dataframe that have names associated with it, not necessarily same class

### Vectors
* `x[1:10]` = first 10 elements of vector x
* `x[is.na(x)]` = returns all NA elements
* `x[!is.na(x)]` = returns all non NA elements
    * `x > 0` = would return logical vector comparing all elements to 0 (`TRUE`/`FALSE` for all values except for NA and `NA` for NA elements (NA a placeholder)
* `x[x>"a"]` = selects all elements bigger than a (lexicographical order in place)
* `x[logicalIndex]` = select all elements where logical index = TRUE
* `x[-c(2, 10)]` = returns everything **but** the second and tenth element
* `vect <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` = names values of a vector with corresponding names
* `names(vect)` = returns element names for object
    * `names(vet) <- c("a", "b", "c")` = assign/change names of vector
* `identical(obj1, obj2)` = returns TRUE if two objects are exactly equal
* `all.equal(obj1, obj2)` = returns TRUE if two objects are near equal

### Lists
* `x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6)`
* `x[1]` or `x["foo"]` = returns the list object `foo`
* `x[[2]]` or `x[["bar"]]` or `x$bar` = returns the content of the second element from the list (in this case vector without name attribute)
    * ***Note**: `$` can’t extract multiple elements *
* `x[c(1, 3)]` = extract multiple elements of list
* `x[[name]]` = extract using variable, where as `$` must match name of element
* `x[[c(1, 3)]]` or `x[[1]][[3]]` = extracted nested elements of list third element of the first object extracted from the list

### Matrices
* `x[1, 2]` = extract the (row, column) element
    * `x[,2]` or `x[1,]` = extract the entire column/row
* `x[ , 11:17]` = subset the x `data.frame` with all rows, but only 11 to 17 columns
* when an element from the matrix is retrieved, a vector is returned
    * behavior can be turned off (force return a matrix) by adding `drop = FALSE`
        * `x[1, 2, drop = F]`

### Partial Matching
* works with `[[]]` and `$`
* `$` automatically partial matches the name (`x$a`)
* `[[]]` can partial match by adding exact = `FALSE`
    * `x[["a", exact = false]]`

$\pagebreak$

## Logic
* `<`, `>=` = less than, greater or equal to
* `==` = exact equality
* `!=` = inequality
* `A | B` = union
* `A & B` = intersection
* `!` = negation
* `&` or `|` evaluates every instance/element in vector
* `&&` or `||` evaluate only first element
    * ***Note**: All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators *
* `isTRUE(condition)` = returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` of the condition
* `xor(arg1, arg2)` = exclusive OR, one argument must equal `TRUE` one must equal `FALSE`
* `which(condition)` = find the indicies of elements that satisfy the condition (TRUE)
* `any(condition)` = `TRUE` if one or more of the elements in logical vector is `TRUE`
* `all(condition)` = `TRUE` if all of the elements in logical vector is `TRUE`


## Understanding Data
* use `class()`, `dim()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `names()` to understand dataset
    * `object.size(data.frame)` = returns how much space the dataset is occupying in memory
* `head(data.frame, 10)`, `tail(data.frame, 10)` = returns first/last 10 rows of data; default = 6
* `summary()` = provides different output for each variable, depending on class,
    * for numerical variables, displays min max, mean median, etx.
    * for categorical (factor) variables, displays number of times each value occurs
* `table(data.frame$variable)` = table of all values of the variable, and how many observations there are for each
    * ***Note**: mean for variables that only have values 1 and 0 = proportion of success*
* `str(data.frame)` = structure of data, provides data class, num of observations vs variables, and name of class of each variable and preview of its contents
    * compactly display the internal structure of an R object
    * "What’s in this object"
    * well-suited to compactly display the contents of lists
+ `view(data.frame)` = opens and view the content of the data frame

$\pagebreak$

## Split-Apply-Combine Funtions
* loop functions = convenient ways of implementing the Split-Apply-Combine strategy for data analysis

### `split()`
* takes a vector/objects and splits it into group b a factor or list of factors
* `split(x, f, drop = FALSE)`
    * `x` = vector/list/data frame
    * `f` = factor/list of factors
    * `drop` = whether empty factor levels should be dropped
* `interactions(gl(2, 5), gl(5, 2))` = 1.1, 1.2, … 2.5
    - `gl(n, m)` = group level function
        * `n` = number of levels
        * `m` = number of repetitions
    - `split` function can do this by passing in list(f1, f2) in argument
        * `split(data, list(gl(2, 5), gl(5, 2)))` = splits the data into 1.1, 1.2, … 2.5 levels

### `apply()`
* evaluate a function (often anonymous) over the margins of an array
* often used to apply a function to the row/columns of a matrix
* can be used to average array of matrices (general arrays)
* `apply(x, margin = 2, FUN, ...)`
    * `x` = array
    * `MARGIN` = 2 (column), 1 (row)
    * `FUN` = function
    * `…` = other arguments that need to be passed to other functions
* ***examples***
    * `apply(x, 1, sum)` or `apply(x, 1, mean)` = find row sums/means
    * `apply(x, 2, sum)` or `apply(x, 2, mean)` = find column sums/means
    * `apply(x, 1, quantile, props = c(0.25, 0.75))` = find 25% 75% percentile of each row
    * `a <- array(rnorm(2*2*10), c(2, 2, 10))` = create 10 2x2 matrix
    * `apply(a, c(1, 2), mean)` = returns the means of 10


### `lapply()`
* loops over a `list` and evaluate a function on each element and always returns a **`list`**
    - ***Note**: since input must be a list, it is possible that conversion may be needed*
* `lapply(x, FUN, ...)` = takes list/vector as input, applies a function to each element of the list, returns a list of the same length
    * `x` = list (if not list, will be coerced into list through "as.list", if not possible —> error)
        * `data.frame` are treated as collections of lists and can be used here
    * `FUN` = function (without parentheses)
        * anonymous functions are acceptable here as well - (i.e `function(x) x[,1]`)
    * `…` = other/additional arguments to be passed for FUN (i.e. `min`, `max` for `runif()`)
* ***example***
    * `lapply(data.frame, class)` = the data.frame is a list of vectors, the `class` value for each vector is returned in a list (name of function, `class`, is without parentheses)
    * `lapply(values, function(elem), elem[2])` = example of an anonymous function


### `sapply()`
* performs same function as `lapply()` except it simplifies the result
    * if result is of length 1 in every element, sapply returns vector
    * if result is vectors of the same length (>1) for each element, sapply returns matrix
    * if not possible to simplify, `sapply` returns a `list` (same as `lapply()`)


### `vapply()`
* safer version of `sapply` in that it allows to you specify the format for the result
    * `vapply(flags, class, character(1))` = returns the `class` of values in the flags variable in the form of character of length 1 (1 value)

### `tapply()`
* split data into groups, and apply the function to data within each subgroup
* `tapply(data, INDEX, FUN, ..., simplify = FALSE)` = apply a function over subsets of a vector
    * `data` = vector
    * `INDEX` = factor/list of factors
    * `FUN` = function
    * `…` = arguments to be passed to function
    * `simplify` = whether to simplify the result
* ***example***
    - `x <- c(rnorm(10), runif(10), rnorm(10, 1))`
    - `f <- gl(3, 10); tapply(x, f, mean)` = returns the mean of each group (f level) of x data

### `mapply()`
* multivariate apply, applies a function in parallel over a set of arguments
* `mapply(FUN, ..., MoreArgs = NULL, SIMPLIFY = TRUE)`
    * `FUN` = function
    * `…` = arguments to apply over
    * `MoreArgs` = list of other arguments to FUN
    * `SIMPLIFY` = whether the result should be simplified
* ***example***
```{r}
mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)
```

### `aggregate()`
* aggregate computes summary statistics of data subsets (similar to multiple `tapply` at the same time)
* `aggregate(list(name = dataToCompute), list(name = factorVar1,name = factorVar2), function, na.rm = TRUE)`
    * `dataToCompute` = this is what the function will be applied on
    * `factorVar1, factorVar1` = factor variables to split the data by
    * ***Note**: order matters here in terms of how to break down the data *
    * `function` = what is applied to the subsets of data, can be sum/mean/median/etc
    * `na.rm = TRUE` $\rightarrow$ removes NA values

$\pagebreak$

## Simulation
* `sample(values, n, replace = FALSE)` = generate random samples
     * `values` = values to sample from
     * `n` = number of values generated
     * `replace` = with or without replacement
    * `sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE, prob=c(.2, .2…))` = choose four values from the range specified with replacing (same numbers can show up twice), with probabilities specified
    * `sample(vector)` = can be used to permute/rearrange elements of a vector
    * `sample(c(y, z), 100)` = select 100 random elements from combination of values y and z
    * `sample(10)` = select positive integer sample of size 10 without repeat
* Each probability distribution functions usually have 4 functions associated with them:
    * `r***` function (for "random") $\rightarrow$ random number generation (ex. `rnorm`)
    * `d***` function (for "density") $\rightarrow$ calculate density (ex. `dunif`)
    * `p***` function (for "probability") $\rightarrow$ cumulative distribution (ex. `ppois`)
    * `q***` function (for "quantile") $\rightarrow$ quantile function (ex. `qbinom`)
* If $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal distribution, then `pnorm(q)` = $\Phi(q)$ and qnorm(p) = $\Phi^{-1}(q)$.
* `set.seed()` = sets seed for randon number generator to ensure that the same data/analysis can be reproduced

### Simulation Examples
* `rbinom(1, size = 100, prob = 0.7)` = returns a binomial random variable that represents the number of successes in a give number of independent trials
    * `1` = corresponds number of observations
    * `size = 100` = corresponds with the number of independent trials that culminate to each resultant observation
    * `prob = 0.7` = probability of success
* `rnorm(n, mean = m, sd = s)` = generate n random samples from the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, std deviation = 1 by default)
    * `rnorm(1000)` = 1000 draws from the standard normal distribution

    * `log` = evaluate on log scale
* `pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)`
    * `lower.tail` = left side, `FALSE` = right
* `qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)`
    * `lower.tail` = left side, `FALSE` = right
* `rpois(n, lambda)` = generate random samples from the poisson distrbution
    * `n` = number of observations generated

* `rpois(n, r)` = generating Poisson Data
    * `n` = number of values
    * `r` = rate
* `ppois(n, r)` = cumulative distribution
    * `ppois(2, 2)` = $Pr(x<=2)$
* `replicate(n, rpois())` = repeat operation n times

### Generate Numbers for a Linear Model
* Linear model
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
~\mbox{where}~ \epsilon \sim N(0, 2^2), x \sim N(0, 1^2),  \beta_0 = 0.5,  \beta_1 = 2
$$
``` {r}
set.seed(20)
x <- rnorm(100)          # normal
x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5) # binomial
e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
y <- 0.5 + 2* x + e
```
* Poisson model
$$
Y ~ Poisson(\mu) \\
log(\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x  \\
~\mbox{where}~ \beta_0 = 0.5,  \beta_1 = 2
$$
``` {r}
x <- rnorm(100)
log.mu <- 0.5 + 0.3* x
y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu))
```

## Dates and Times
 * `Date` = date class, stored as number of days since 1970-01-01
 * `POSIXct` = time class, stored as number of seconds since 1970-01-01
 * `POSIXlt` = time class, stored as list of sec min hours
 * `Sys.Date()` = today's date
 * `unclass(obj)` = returns what obj looks like internally
 * `Sys.time()` = current time in POSIXct class
 * `t2 <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())` = time in POSIXlt class
     * `t2$min` = return min of time (only works for POSIXlt class)
 * `weekdays(date)`, `months(date)`, `quarters(date)` = returns weekdays, months, and quarters of time/date inputed
 * `strptime(string, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")` = convert string into time format using the format specified
 * `difftime(time1, time2, units = 'days')` = difference in times by the specified unit


## Base Graphics
* `data(set)` = load data
* `plot(data)` = R plots the data as best as it can
    * `x` = variable, x axis
    * `y` = variable
    * `xlab, ylab` = corresponding labels
    * `main, sub` = title, subtitle
    * `col = 2` or `col = "red"` = color
    * `pch = 2` = different symbols for points
    * `xlim,ylim(v1, v2)` = restrict range of plot
* `boxplot(x ~ y, data = d)` = creates boxplot for x vs y variables using the data.frame provided
* `hist(x, breaks)` = plots histogram of the data
    - `break = 100` = split data into 100 bins


$\pagebreak$

## Reading Tabular Data
* `read.table(), read.csv()` = most common, read text files (rows, col) return data frame
* `readLines()` = read lines of text, returns character vector
* `source(file)` = read R code
* `dget()` = read R code files (R objects that have been reparsed)
* `load()`, `unserialize()` = read binary objects
* writing data
    * `write.table()`, `writeLines()`, `dump()`, `put()`, `save()`, `serialize()`
* `read.table()` arguments:
    * `file` = name of file/connection
    * `header` = indicator if file contains header
    * `sep` = string indicating how columns are separated
    * `colClasses` = character vector indicating what each column is in terms of class
    * `nrows` = number of rows in dataset
    * `comment.char` = char indicating beginning of comment
    * `skip` = number of lines to skip in the beginning
    * `stringsAsFactors` = defaults to TRUE, should characters be coded as Factor
* `read.table` can be used without any other argument to create data.frame
    * telling R what type of variables are in each column is helpful for larger datasets (efficiency)
    * `read.csv()` = `read.table` except default sep is comma (`read.table` default is `sep = " "` and `header = TRUE`)

### Larger Tables
 * ***Note**: help page for read.table important*
 * need to know how much RAM is required $\rightarrow$ calculating memory requirements
    * `numRow` x `numCol` x 8 bytes/numeric value = size required in bites
    * double the above results and convert into GB = amount of memory recommended
 * set `comment.char = ""` to save time if there are no comments in the file
 * specifying `colClasses` can make reading data much faster
 * `nrow = n` = number of rows to read in (can help with memory usage)
     * `initial <- read.table("file", rows = 100)` = read first 100 lines
     * `classes <- sapply(initial, class)` = determine what classes the columns are
     * `tabAll <- read.table("file", colClasses = classes)` = load in the entire file with determined classes

### Textual Data Formats
 * `dump` and `dput` preserve metadata
 * text formats are editable, not space efficient, and work better with version control system (they can only track changes in text files)
 * `dput(obj, file = "file.R")` = creates R code to store all data and meta data in "file.R" (ex. data, class, names, row.names)
 * `dget("file.R")` = loads the file/R code and reconstructs the R object
 * `dput` can only be used on one object, where as `dump` can be used on multiple objects
 * `dump(c("obj1", "obj2"), file= "file2.R")` = stores two objects
 * `source("file2.R")` = loads the objects

### Interfaces to the Outside World
* `url()` = function can read from webpages
* `file()` = read uncompressed files
* `gzfile(), bzfile()` = read compressed files (gzip, bzip2)
* `file(description = "", open = "")` = file syntax, creates connection
    * `description` = description of file
    * `open` = r -readonly, w - writing, a - appending, rb/wb/ab - reading/writing/appending binary
    * `close()` = closes connection
    * `readLines()` = can be used to read lines after connection has been established
* `download.file(fileURL, destfile = "fileName", method = "curl")`
    - `fileURL` = url of the file that needs to be downloaded
    - `destfile = "fileName"` = specifies where the file is to be saved
        + `dir/fileName` = directories can be referenced here
    - `method = "curl"` = necessary for downloading files from "https://" links on Macs
        + `method = "auto"` = should work on all other machines


$\pagebreak$

## Control Structures
* Common structures are
    * `if`, `else` = testing a condition
    * `for` = execute a loop a fixed number of times
    * `while` = execute a loop while a condition is true
    * `repeat` = execute an infinite loop
    * `break` = break the execution of a loop
    * `next` = skip an interation of a loop
    * `return` = exit a function
* ***Note**: Control structures are primarily useful for writing programs; for command-line interactive work, the `apply` functions are more useful *

### `if - else`
```r
# basic structure
if(<condition>) {
    ## do something
} else {
    ## do something else
}

# if tree
if(<condition1>) {
    ## do something
} else if(<condition2>) {
    ## do something different
} else {
    ## do something different
}
```
* `y <- if(x>3){10} else {0}` = slightly different implementation than normal, focus on assigning value

### `for`
```{r}
# basic structure
for(i in 1:10) {
    # print(i)
}

# nested for loops
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
    for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
        # print(x[i, j])
    }
}
```
* `for(letter in x)` = loop through letter in character vector
* `seq_along(vector)` = create a number sequence from 1 to length of the vector
* `seq_len(length)` = create a number sequence that starts at 1 and ends at length specified

### `while`
```{r}
count <- 0
while(count < 10) {
    # print(count)
    count <- count + 1
}
```
* conditions can be combined with logical operators

### `repeat` and `break`
* `repeat` initiates an infinite loop
* not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their uses
* The only way to exit a `repeat` loop is to call `break`

```r
x0 <- 1
tol <- 1e-8
repeat {
    x1 <- computeEstimate()
    if(abs(x1 - x0) < tol) {
        break
    } else {
        x0 <- x1 # requires algorithm to converge
    }
}
```
* ***Note**: The above loop is a bit dangerous because there’s no guarantee it will stop *
    * Better to set a hard limit on the number of iterations (e.g. using a `for` loop) and then report whether convergence was achieved or not.


### `next` and `return`
* `next` = (no parentheses) skips an element, to continue to the next iteration
* `return` = signals that a function should exit and return a given value
```{r}
for(i in 1:100) {
    if(i <= 20) {
        ## Skip the first 20 iterations
        next
    }
    ## Do something here
}
```

$\pagebreak$

## Functions
* `name <- function(arg1, arg2, …){ }`
    * inputs can be specified with default values by `arg1 = 10`
    * it is possible to define an argument to `NULL`
    * returns **last expression** of function
    * many functions have `na.rm`, can be set to `TRUE` to remove `NA` values from calculation
* structure
```r
f <- function(<arguments>) {
    ## Do something interesting
}
```
* function are first class object and can be **treated like other objects** (pass into other functions)
    * functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside of another function
* function have named arguments (i.e. `x = mydata`) which can be used to specifiy **default values**
    * `sd(x = mydata)` (matching by name)
* formal arguments = arguments included in the functional definition
    * `formals()` = returns all formal arguments
    * not all functional call specifies all arguments, some can be missing and may have default values
    * `args()` = return all arguments you can specify
    * multiple arguments inputted in random orders (R performs positional matching) $\rightarrow$ not recommended
    * argument matching order: exact $\rightarrow$ partial $\rightarrow$ positional
        - *partial* = instead of typing `data = x`, use `d = x`
* **Lazy Evaluation**
    * R will evaluate as needed, so everything executes until an error occurs
        * `f <- function (a, b) {a^2}`
        * if b is not used in the function, calling `f(5)` will not produce an error
* `...` argument
    * used to extend other functions by representing the rest of the arguments
    * generic functions use `...` to pass extra arguments (i.e. mean = 1, sd = 2)
    * necessary when the number of arguments passed can not be known in advance
         * functions that use `...` = `paste()`, `cat()`
    * ***Note**: arguments coming after `...` must be explicitly matched and cannot be partially matched *


$\pagebreak$

## Scoping
* scoping rules determine how a value is associated with a free variable in a function
* **free variables** = variables not explicitly defined in the function (not arguments, or local variables - variable defined in the function)
* R uses **lexical/static scoping**
    * common alternative = **dynamic scoping**
    * **lexical scoping** = values of free vars are searched in the environment in which the function is defined
        * environment = collection of symbol/value pairs (x = 3.14)
            * each package has its own environment
            * only environment **without** parent environment is the *empty environment*
    * **closure/function closure** = function + associated environment
* search order for free variable
    1. environment where the function is defined
    2. parent environment
    3. ... (repeat if multiple parent environments)
    4. top level environment: global environment (worspace) or namespace package
    5. empty environment $\rightarrow$ produce error
* when a function/variable is called, R searches through the following list to match the first result
    1. `.GlobalEnv`
    2. `package:stats `
    3. `package:graphics`
    4. `package:grDeviced`
    5. `package:utils`
    6. `package:datasets`
    7. `package:methods`
    8. `Autoloads`
    9. `package:base`
* **order matters**
    * `.GlobalEnv` = everything defined in the current workspace
    * any package that gets loaded with `library()` gets put in position 2 of the above search list
    * namespaces are separate for functions and non-functions
        * possible for object c and function c to coexist

### Scoping Example
```{r}
make.power <- function(n) {
    pow <- function(x) {
         x^n
    }
    pow
}
cube <- make.power(3)   # defines a function with only n defined (x^3)
square <- make.power(2) # defines a function with only n defined (x^2)
cube(3)                 # defines x = 3
square(3)               # defines x = 3

# returns the free variables in the function
ls(environment(cube))

# retrieves the value of n in the cube function
get("n", environment(cube))
```

### Lexical vs Dynamic Scoping Example
```{r}
y <- 10
f <- function(x) {
    y <- 2
    y^2 + g(x)
}
g <- function(x) {
    x*y
}
```
* **Lexical Scoping**
    1. `f(3)` $\rightarrow$ calls `g(x)`
    2. `y` isn’t defined locally in `g(x)` $\rightarrow$ searches in parent environment (working environment/global workspace)
    3. finds `y` $\rightarrow$ `y = 10`
* **Dynamic Scoping**
    1. `f(3)` $\rightarrow$ calls `g(x)`
    2. `y` isn’t defined locally in `g(x)` $\rightarrow$ searches in calling environment (f function)
    3. find `y` $\rightarrow$ `y <- 2`
    * **parent frame** = refers to calling environment in R, environment from which the function was called
* ***Note**: when the defining environment and calling environment is the same, lexical and dynamic scoping produces the same result *
* **Consequences of Lexical Scoping**
    * all objects must be carried in memory
    * all functions carry pointer to their defining environment (memory address)

### Optimization
* optimization routines in R (`optim`, `nlm`, `optimize`) require you to pass a function whose argument is a vector of parameters
    * ***Note**: these functions **minimize**, so use the negative constructs to maximize a normal likelihood *
* **constructor functions** = functions to be fed into the optimization routines
* ***example***

```{r}
# write constructor function
make.NegLogLik <- function(data, fixed=c(FALSE,FALSE)) {
    params <- fixed
    function(p) {
         params[!fixed] <- p
         mu <- params[1]
         sigma <- params[2]
         a <- -0.5*length(data)*log(2*pi*sigma^2)
         b <- -0.5*sum((data-mu)^2) / (sigma^2)
         -(a + b)
    }
}
# initialize seed and print function
set.seed(1); normals <- rnorm(100, 1, 2)
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals); nLL

# Estimating Prameters
optim(c(mu = 0, sigma = 1), nLL)$par

# Fixing sigma = 2
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(FALSE, 2))
optimize(nLL, c(-1, 3))$minimum

# Fixing mu = 1
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(1, FALSE))
optimize(nLL, c(1e-6, 10))$minimum
```


$\pagebreak$

## Debugging
* `message`: generic notification/diagnostic message, execution continues
    * `message()` = generate message
* `warning`: something’s wrong but not fatal, execution continues
    * `warning()` = generate warning
* `error`: fatal problem occurred, execution stops
    * `stop()` = generate error
* `condition`: generic concept for indicating something unexpected can occur
* `invisible()` = suppresses auto printing
* ***Note**: random number generator must be controlled to reproduce problems (`set.seed` to pinpoint problem) *
* `traceback`: prints out function call stack after error occurs
    * must be called right after error
* `debug`: flags function for debug mode, allows to step through function one line at a time
    - `debug(function)` = enter debug mode
* `browser`: suspends the execution of function wherever its placed
    - embedded in code and when the code is run, the browser comes up
* `trace`: allows inserting debugging code into a function at specific places
* `recover`: error handler, freezes at point of error
    * `options(error = recover)` = instead of console, brings up menu (similar to `browser`)



## R Profiler
* optimizing code cannot be done without performance analysis and profiling
```{r}
# system.time example
system.time({
    n <- 1000
    r <- numeric(n)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        x <- rnorm(n)
        r[i] <- mean(x)
    }
})
```
* `system.time(expression)`
    * takes R expression, returns amount of time needed to execute (assuming you know where)
    * computes time (in sec) $\rightarrow$ gives time until error if error occurs
    * can wrap multiple lines of code with `{}`
    * returns object of class `proc_time`
         * **user time** = time computer experience
         * **elapsed time** = time user experience
         * usually close for standard computation
              * ***elapse > user*** = CPU wait around other processes in the background (read webpage)
              * ***elapsed < user*** = multiple processor/core (use multi-threaded libraries)
    * ***Note**: R doesn’t multi-thread (performing multiple calculations at the same time) with basic package *
         * Basic Linear Algebra Standard [BLAS] libraries do, prediction, regression routines, matrix
         * i.e. `vecLib`/Accelerate, `ATLAS`, `ACML`, `MKL`
* `Rprof()` = useful for complex code only
    * keeps track of functional call stack at regular intervals and tabulates how much time is spent in each function
    * default sampling interval = 0.02 second
    * calling `Rprof()` generates `Rprof.out` file by default
        * `Rprof("output.out")` = specify the output file
    * ***Note**: should NOT be used with `system.time()` *
* `summaryRprof()` = summarizes `Rprof()` output, 2 methods for normalizing data
    - loads the `Rprof.out` file by default, can specify output file `summaryRprof("output.out")`
    * `by.total` = divide time spent in each function by total run time
    * `by.self` = first subtracts out time spent in functions above in call stack, and calculates ratio to total
    * `$sample.interval` = 0.02 $\rightarrow$ interval
    * `$sampling.time` = 7.41 $\rightarrow$ seconds, elapsed time
        * ***Note**: generally user spends all time at top level function (i.e. `lm()`), but the function simply calls helper functions to do work so it is not useful to know about the top level function times *
    * ***Note**: `by.self` = more useful as it focuses on each individual call/function *
    * ***Note**: R must be compiled with profiles support (generally the case) *
* good to break code into functions so profilers can give useful information about where time is spent
* C/FORTRAN code is not profiled

### Miscellaneous
* `unlist(rss)` = converts a list object into data frame/vector
* `ls("package:elasticnet")` = list methods in package
